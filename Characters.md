## Abigail

**Personality:**
Abigail is independent, adventurous, and rebellious. She has a strong interest in the occult, exploring the local graveyard, and searching for frogs. She's an avid video game player (adept at 'Journey of the Prairie King') and a skilled musician, playing the flute and drums. She can come off as sarcastic or moody, but this is often a defense mechanism stemming from feeling misunderstood by her parents, particularly her mother, Caroline, who worries about her "alternative lifestyle." Despite her tough exterior, she is enthusiastic and friendly once you get to know her.

**History & Relationships:**

- Lives with her parents, Pierre and Caroline, at the local store.
- **Pierre:** Her relationship with her father is strained. He is a traditionalist and can be overprotective. There are strong hints that Pierre may not be her biological father, as Abigail's hair color doesn't match either of her parents, and she mentions she can't remember the last time she dyed it. Caroline mentions she used to take secret walks to the Wizard's Tower, and the Wizard has stated he believes one of the villagers is his daughter. This is a key piece of underlying lore.
- **Caroline:** Her mother wishes she would be more "normal" and worries about her hobbies. Their dynamic is a source of tension for Abigail.
