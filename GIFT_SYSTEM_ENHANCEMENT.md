# üéÅ Enhanced Gift System with Official Stardew Valley Data

## Overview

We've significantly enhanced the gift system in the StardewEchoes mod by integrating the complete official Stardew Valley gift preferences database. This provides the AI with accurate, game-consistent information to make better gift-related decisions.

## What Was Added

### 1. Complete Gift Preferences Database (`api/app/data/gift_preferences.py`)

- **Complete villager data**: All 33 NPCs with their loved, liked, disliked, and hated gifts
- **Birthday information**: Accurate birthday dates for all characters
- **Universal preferences**: Items that are universally loved, liked, disliked, or hated
- **Gift categories**: Organized categorization of items (gems, flowers, fruits, etc.)

**Source**: Based on the [official Steam community guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2133111137)

### 2. Enhanced AI Gift Preference System

The `determine_gift_preference_with_ai()` function now:

1. **Checks official data first**: If an item has a known preference in the game database, uses it directly
2. **Falls back to AI**: For neutral/unknown items, uses AI with comprehensive context
3. **Provides full context**: Gives the AI complete information about the NPC's official preferences

### 3. New API Endpoints

#### `GET /gift_preferences/{npc_name}`

Get complete gift preferences for a specific NPC:

```json
{
  "npc_name": "Abigail",
  "birthday": "Fall 13",
  "preferences": {
    "loved": ["Amethyst", "Blackberry Cobbler", ...],
    "liked": ["All other gems", "All flowers", ...],
    "disliked": ["All fish (except Crab, Lobster, Shrimp, Snail)", ...],
    "hated": ["Holly", "Wild Horseradish"]
  },
  "loved_gifts_total": [...], // Including universal loves
  "summary": {
    "loved_count": 6,
    "liked_count": 7,
    "disliked_count": 4,
    "hated_count": 2
  }
}
```

#### `GET /gift_preferences`

Get summary of all NPCs:

```json
{
  "total_npcs": 33,
  "npcs": {
    "Abigail": {
      "birthday": "Fall 13",
      "loved_count": 6,
      "liked_count": 7,
      "disliked_count": 4,
      "hated_count": 2,
      "top_loved_gifts": ["Amethyst", "Blackberry Cobbler", ...]
    },
    ...
  }
}
```

#### `POST /check_gift_preference`

Check preference for a specific gift:

```json
// Request
{
  "npc_name": "Abigail",
  "item_name": "Amethyst",
  "item_category": "Gem"
}

// Response
{
  "npc_name": "Abigail",
  "item_name": "Amethyst",
  "item_category": "Gem",
  "official_preference": "loved",
  "source": "official_game_data", // or "ai_inference"
  "context": "OFFICIAL STARDEW VALLEY GIFT PREFERENCES FOR ABIGAIL: ..."
}
```

## How It Works

### 1. Gift Detection (C# Mod)

When a player gives a gift, the `GiftHandler` creates a `GiftInfo` object with:

- Item name
- Item category
- Item quality
- Whether it's the NPC's birthday
- Preference set to "unknown" (letting the API decide)

### 2. API Processing

The API processes the gift through:

1. **Official lookup**: Check if the gift has a known preference in the database
2. **Context generation**: Create comprehensive context for the AI including:
   - Official game preferences for that NPC
   - NPC personality traits
   - Similar items that are loved/hated
3. **AI decision**: If needed, use AI to determine preference with full context
4. **Friendship calculation**: Calculate appropriate friendship points based on preference and quality

### 3. AI Context Enhancement

The AI now receives context like:

```
OFFICIAL STARDEW VALLEY GIFT PREFERENCES FOR ABIGAIL:

üéÅ ITEM BEING GIVEN: Amethyst (Category: Gem)
üìä OFFICIAL GAME PREFERENCE: LOVED

‚ù§Ô∏è LOVED GIFTS (Abigail absolutely adores these):
Amethyst, Blackberry Cobbler, Chocolate Cake, Pufferfish, Pumpkin, Spicy Eel

üòä LIKED GIFTS (Abigail appreciates these):
All other gems, All flowers, Quartz, Earth Crystal, Fire Quartz, Frozen Tear...

üéÇ BIRTHDAY: Fall 13

INSTRUCTIONS: Use this official data to determine the exact gift preference...
```
