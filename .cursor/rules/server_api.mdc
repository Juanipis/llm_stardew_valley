# Server-Side (Python FastAPI Backend)

The backend is a Python server built with FastAPI. It handles requests from the mod, interacts with the LLM, manages conversation history in a database, and provides a web interface for user authentication and API token management.

Refer to these documents for implementation details:

- **Web UI and Authentication Logic:** @.github/prompts/backend_web_auth.prompt.md
